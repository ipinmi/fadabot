      1) Check if baby is unconscious by flicking his feet.
      2) Place baby on their back with their head in a neutral position 
      3) Check baby’s mouth for airway blockages like the tongue, food, vomit or blood. If there’s a blockage, use your little finger to clear it.  
      4) If there are no blockages or you’ve cleared blockages, check for breathing. Look for chest movements, listen for breathing sounds, or feel for breath on your cheek. 
      a) Baby breathing normally? Place baby in your arm on their side with their head tilted down. Supporting their neck with your hand 
      b) Baby not responding or baby breathing abnormally? Start CPR. 
      5) Put two fingers in the centre of baby’s chest. Do 100 compressions within a minute. Each compression should push the chest down by about one third. 
      6) Tilt the head back and lift the chin up. Make a complete seal over baby’s nose and mouth with your mouth, and blow in for about one second. That’s one rescue breath; do two, in quick succession. 
      7) If baby starts breathing normally and responding, put baby into the recovery position. Keep watching baby’s breathing.

      Clear blockages with your fingers, then check for breathing.
      5) If there are no blockages or you’ve cleared blockages, check for breathing. Look for chest movements, listen for breathing sounds, or feel for breath on your cheek.
      a) Child breathing normally? Gently roll the child into the recovery position on their side. Regularly check for breathing until the ambulance arrives
      b) Child not responding or child breathing abnormally? Start CPR.

      3) Position yourself vertically above the patient’s chest. Ensure that your arms are straight then press down on the patient’s chest until it is compressed by about one-third.
      4) Release the pressure. Pressing down and releasing is 1 compression. Give 30 compressions followed by 2 breaths. Compressions should be done at a rate of two compressions per second. At least 5 sets of 30 compressions and 2 breaths should be achieved in two minutes and interruptions should be minimized as much as possible.
      6) CPR should be continued until the patient starts breathing normally, you are physically unable to continue, more qualified help arrives and takes over or a healthcare professional directs that CPR be ceased.
      7) Keep in mind that any attempt at resuscitation is better than no attempt at all. Giving only compressions is better than nothing at all.
